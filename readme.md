## üé∂ **Music Genre Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
This project uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify music genres, leveraging the GTZAN Dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore the effectiveness of KNN in genre classification using extracted audio features.

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.

### Project Overview
Music genre classification is a task that categorizes audio samples into predefined genres. This project uses KNN, a simple yet powerful instance-based learning algorithm, to classify tracks based on feature vectors derived from audio data.

### üìÅ Dataset

The project uses the GTZAN Dataset from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com), which includes:

+ Genres: Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip-hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, and Rock.
+ Audio files: 1,000 .wav files (100 files per genre).
+ File format: 30-second .wav files.
+ Music Genre Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### üéõÔ∏è Features Extraction
Using the Librosa library, we extract several key features from each audio file:

Model performance is evaluated based on accuracy and confusion matrix.
### üìä Results
After training and testing, the KNN model achieves an accuracy of approximately X% (adjust based on your results) on the GTZAN dataset. The confusion matrix reveals performance across different genres, highlighting any specific challenges in classification.

### ü§ù Acknowledgments
This project is based on the GTZAN Dataset hosted on Kaggle. Special thanks to the contributors for making this dataset available for research and experimentation.
